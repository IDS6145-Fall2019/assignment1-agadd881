## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

A discrete simulation would be used when looking at the entrance to a subway station as it is basically a queuing system through the turnstiles with a wait in a holding area until the needed train arrives.

This type of simuation was choosen for it's understanding of people through a turnstile at a time is a discrete system.

The simulation would be setup with a set amount of turnstiles in the system and turnstiles would be added until the requirement for through put would be able to be reached. For instance if 100 people needed to move through the system per minute to make sure that there is not a crowd gathering (over 20 people), then turnstiles could be added into the simulation to make these requirements are met.
